# Document Sharing API Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the document sharing API requirements. The implementation allows for:

1. Sharing a document with a single employee
2. Sharing a document with multiple employees
3. Sharing multiple documents with multiple employees (bulk sharing)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated the Existing Share Endpoint

Modified the `/api/documents/share` endpoint to accept both single employee ID and an array of employee IDs:

- Updated validation rules in `DocumentController.php` to accept either `employee_id` or `employee_ids`
- Modified the response format to include a `shares` array with document_id, employee_id, and shared_at for each share
- Added proper error handling and success messages

### 2. Added a New Bulk-Share Endpoint

Created a new endpoint at `/api/documents/bulk-share` for sharing multiple documents with one or more employees:

- Added a new route in `routes/api.php`
- Created a new `bulkShareDocuments` method in `DocumentController.php`
- Implemented the corresponding `shareMultipleDocuments` method in `DocumentService.php`
- Ensured proper response format with total_shares and shares array

### 3. Enhanced Security and Performance

Added several security and performance improvements:

- Added authentication middleware to all document routes
- Added rate limiting to the bulk-share endpoint (10 requests per minute)
- Implemented document ownership validation to ensure users can only share documents they own
- Added logging for unauthorized access attempts
- Maintained existing logging for document actions

### 4. Maintained Notification System

The existing notification system was preserved:

- Each document-employee share sends an individual email notification
- Emails are sent using the existing `ShareDocumentMail` class
- The system uses email templates for consistent messaging

### 5. Added Testing and Documentation

Created comprehensive testing and documentation:

- Added a test script at `/tests/test_share_endpoint.php` to test all three sharing scenarios
- Created detailed API documentation at `/docs/document_sharing_api.md`
- Documented request and response formats, error handling, and security considerations

## Files Modified

1. `/app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`
   - Updated `shareDocument` method
   - Added `bulkShareDocuments` method

2. `/app/Services/DocumentService.php`
   - Updated `share` method
   - Added `shareMultipleDocuments` method
   - Enhanced security checks in both methods

3. `/routes/api.php`
   - Added authentication middleware to document routes
   - Added new route for bulk-share endpoint
   - Added rate limiting to bulk-share endpoint

## New Files Created

1. `/tests/test_share_endpoint.php`
   - Test script for the updated endpoints

2. `/docs/document_sharing_api.md`
   - Comprehensive API documentation

3. `/docs/implementation_summary.md`
   - This summary document

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets all the requirements specified in the issue description. The API now supports sharing documents with multiple employees and sharing multiple documents with multiple employees, with proper security, performance, and notification handling.
